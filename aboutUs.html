    <h3>LETTER FROM OUR ARCHON</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Delta Beta Chapter of Phi Sigma Sigma at the University of Rochester! On this website you can get a glimpse of what our sisterhood entails. From athletes to artists, scientists to historians, volunteers to activists, and so much more, we pride ourselves in being a diverse group of women who are connected by our desire to “Aim High”, as represented by our motto.</p>
		
    <p>Throughout our time in college, we strive to better ourselves by creating a standard of sisterhood, community involvement, and mutual encouragement. We have formed unbreakable bonds through the many nights we have spent together - laughing, crying, dancing, studying, and everything in between. We support each other no matter what, and constantly push each other to reach new heights.</p>
		
    <p>I am so incredibly thankful that I can call myself a part of this sisterhood.</p>
		
    <p>The Delta Beta Chapter is proud to represent the Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation and the Kids In Need Foundation, which raise money for school and college readiness, focusing on young students who deal with extreme financial stress. Annually, we host a kickball tournament, Kicks for College, in the fall, and a trivia night, Trivia for Tots, in the Spring to contribute to the Foundation. Outside of these events, our sisters volunteer throughout the school and community, and contribute to other group’s causes whenever they can.</p>
		
    <p>Phi Sig has given me something irreplaceable. Since joining, I have seen myself go through a transformation, and I am so proud of the person I have become. My sisters have helped me realize that within everyone is a fire, which when nourished, creates a woman who is confident, passionate, outspoken, and unapologetically herself. Not only have I grown, but I’ve gotten the privilege to watch the women around me succeed and find happiness.</p>
    
    <p>I know that I have made friends for life in Phi Sig. We are a group of women that are all so different, yet through the sisterhood and philanthropy that we share, we are able to lean on one another. I am so excited to lead the women that I look up to, and cannot wait to see what they do next.</p>
    
    <p>Please enjoy our website, and see why we call Phi Sig home.</p>
