    <h3>OUR PHILANTHROPY</h3>
    
    <p>Each year our chapter and all other Phi Sigma Sigma chapters raise money to donate to the International Phi Sigma Sigma foundation. Our foundation prepares the next generation of leaders and scholars. Through scholarships, grants, and donations to our partner organizations, we support critical educational development in communities. 
    Learn Today. Lead Tomorrow. </p>
    
    <p>In 2013, Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation announced its new philanthropic cause, School and College Readiness, which we believe is the embodiment of our motto: Aim High. Our decision to choose school and college readiness was determined by Phi Sigma Sigma members expressing a desire for more opportunities to volunteer locally and to make a significant difference in the lives of others. </p>

    <p>After much research on different philanthropic causes, these facts galvanized our decision to focus on school and college readiness:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><p>1 in 5 American children live in poverty.</p></li>
      <li><p>40% of children living in poverty aren't prepared for school.</p></li>
      <li><p>7,000 students drop out of high school every school day.</p></li>
      <li><p>93% of middle school students report that their goal is to attend college. But only 44% enroll in college, and only 26% graduate with a college diploma within six years of entering college.</p></li>
      <li><p>High school seniors who set the goal of earning a postsecondary degree are 28% more likely to apply to college than students with no aspirations to attend college.</p></li>
      <li><p>Experts estimate that by 2020 there will be 123 million high-paying, high-skill jobs in the United States, but only 50 million Americans will be qualified for these jobs. </p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By focusing our philanthropic efforts on School and College Readiness, we can make a limitless difference in our local and national communities by helping the next generation of leaders reach their academic potential regardless of class, race, upbringing or gender. 

    <center><h4>Our Philanthropic Partner: Kids In Need Foundation</h4></center>
    <p>The Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation donates our money to the Kids In Need Foundation. KINF is dedicated to providing those in need of school supplies with the tools necessary to be successful in the classroom. KINF partners with selection organizations nationwide  to directly deliver school suppplies to students in needy communities by providing pre-assembled backpacks filled with essential school supplies. So far, KINF has already distributed 80,000 backpacks to students in need. <a href="https://www.kinf.org/">Learn more here.</a></p>
