    <h3>LETTER FROM OUR RECRUITMENT CHAIR</h3>
    
    <p>Dear Potential New Members,</p>  
 
    <p>As Membership Recruitment Chair of Phi Sig, I would like to welcome you to the University of Rochester. The Delta Beta chapter is excited to meet each of you as you participate in formal recruitment this January. We are eager to be a part of your journey in finding your home here in the U of R community.</p>
 
    <p>As the recruitment period rolls around each year, the sisters of Delta Beta are given the chance to reflect on what brings us together as Phi Sigs. Phi Sigma Sigma is the first nonsectarian sorority. Our founders promoted a sisterhood that is open to all, regardless of background, while focusing on our core values of inclusiveness, lifelong learning, and leadership by service. As we look to welcome the new members of our Spring 2018 class, we embrace the individuality of each member and seek to continue the mission of our founders by inspiring personal development in each sister, perpetuating the advancement of womanhood, and igniting positive change in the world around us.</p>
 
    <p>Despite our excitement, we also recognize that recruitment can be a daunting process. Before I came to college, I had a special connection to the all-girls sleepaway camp I attended for six consecutive summers. The older counselors were in sororities at their own colleges and assured me that joining a sorority would give me my new “home away from home.” </p>

    <p>I was eager to go through recruitment as a freshman and inquired about Greek Life early on, while meeting sorority women from different chapters. Despite my impressions and preconceived expectations about which chapter I would join, I maintained an open mind during formal recruitment. While the process of recruitment was a blur, I do remember thinking to myself at Phi Sigma Sigma's Preference Night that these were the girls I could see myself getting to know on a deeper level.</p>

    <p>While sororities have often been portrayed by the media as having to fit into a “cookie-cutter” model, being in Phi Sig has given me the opposite experience. For the first time in my life, instead of feeling judged for expressing myself, I felt embraced for who I was and was given the freedom to be who I want to be. My taste in music, clothing style, hidden passions, and so much more have been validated and my confidence strengthened since I joined Phi Sig. Phi Sigma Sigma has helped me develop into the woman I am today and brought me lifelong friendships with a group of women I may have never met otherwise.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to take the step and sign up for formal recruitment this spring and find an organization that you can call your home. If you have any questions about recruitment or our chapter, please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>

    <p>LITP</p>
