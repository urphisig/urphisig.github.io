    <h3>LETTER FROM OUR RECRUITMENT CHAIR</h3>
    
    <p>Dear Potential New Members,</p>  
 
    <p>The Delta Beta chapter is excited to meet each of you as you participate in formal recruitment this January! We are eager to be a part of your journey in finding your home here in the U of R community.</p>
 
    <p>As the recruitment period rolls around each year, the sisters of Delta Beta are given the chance to reflect on what brings us together. Phi Sigma Sigma is the first nonsectarian sorority. Our founders promoted a sisterhood open to all regardless of background; choosing to focus on our core values of inclusiveness, lifelong learning, and leadership by service. As we look to welcome the new members of our Spring 2018 class, we embrace our individuality and seek to continue the mission of our founders by inspiring personal development in each sister, perpetuating the advancement of womanhood, and igniting positive change in the world around us.</p>
 
    <p>We recognize that recruitment can be a daunting process. Before I came to college, I had a special connection to the all-girls sleepaway camp I attended for six consecutive summers. The older counselors there were in sororities at their own schools and assured me that joining a sorority would give me my new “home away from home” after camp ended.</p>

    <p>I was eager to go through recruitment as a freshman and inquired about Greek Life early on. I met sorority women from the different chapters on campus and pictured myself finding that home. Despite first impressions and inevitable predictions about which chapter I would join, I was cautious about maintaining an open mind during formal recruitment. While making the decision was difficult, I remember thinking to myself on Preference Night, “These are the girls I can see myself getting to know beneath the surface.”</p>

    <p>While the media has often portrayed sororities as requiring women to fit into a “cookie-cutter” model, being in Phi Sig has given me the opposite experience. For the first time, instead of feeling judged for expressing myself, I felt embraced to be who I want to be. My love for music festivals, piercings, mom jeans, and so much more have been validated and my confidence strengthened since I joined Phi Sig. The support I received from my sisters to do what makes me happy is what encouraged me to take my first art class and minor in Studio Arts! Phi Sigma Sigma has helped me develop into the woman I am today and brought me lifelong friendships with a group of women I may have never met otherwise.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to make the first step and sign up for formal recruitment this spring and find an organization that you can call your home. If you have any questions about recruitment or our chapter, please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
